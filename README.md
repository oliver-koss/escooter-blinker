This code is running on my ESP32 built into my Ninebot G30 max.
The ESP32 controls a LED Strip on my luggage rack that is used for the backlight and the indicators. On the handle bar I mounted a IÂ²C Display which displays the current speed and time which are determined by a NEO-6M GPS Speed Module.
